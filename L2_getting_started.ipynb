      "1. Personalized Message: Start by writing a personalized message that speaks to your friendship with Andrew. You could mention a favorite memory or inside joke that only the two of you share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to my favorite friend, Andrew! I can't believe it's been [X] years since we met. You've been there for me through thick and thin, and I'm so grateful for your friendship. Here's to another year of adventures and good times together! üéâ\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to the most awesome Andrew in the world! May your day be as epic as your beard and your love for [insert hobby or interest here] üòÇ\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Heartfelt Words: If you want to express your feelings in a more heartfelt way, try writing a message that speaks to the importance of Andrew in your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Andrew, you're more than just a friend to me. You're a constant source of support, laughter, and inspiration. I'm so grateful to have you in my life, and I can't wait to see what the next year brings for you. Happy birthday, my dear friend! ‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Inside Joke: If you and Andrew share a special inside joke or reference, consider including it in your card. It will make the message more personal and meaningful to him.\n",

      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
